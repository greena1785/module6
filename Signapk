Flutter How to Generate the Signed Apk.
1. Create the JKS File
To create the JKS file, run the below command on the terminal. Please replace Your User name, app name, and alias as you want.
keytool -genkey -v -keystore C:/Users/Your User Name/app-name.jks -storetype JKS -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias genotechies
When the command runs, it will ask for the following details to create the JKS file.
 


2. Edited the Build.gradle File
Then you need to add the following code snippet to the build.gradle(app level) file. signingConfigs part should be inside the android block.
signingConfigs {
    release {
        storeFile file("Path to jks file")
        storePassword "******"
        keyAlias "genotechies"
        keyPassword "******"
    }
}
Build types also should change like this.
buildTypes {
    release {
        signingConfig signingConfigs.release
    }
}
 

3. Build the signed release app bundle
Finally, you can build the signed app bundle by running the following command.
flutter build appbundle --release
You can see the built bundle here,
